# Shuri-Admin

## Environment Integration

The environment intergration of `Shuri-Admin` constitutes a bunch of flows compelled to get started, accordingly cited below:

- Install `Vue CLI` for starters with `yarn` or `npm install -g @vue/cli`.
  (Supposedly `NodeJS` is already installed if not click [here](https://nodejs.org/) for further documentation or instructions on its installation.)
- Install `Git` latest version [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  (To use git you won't need to be excellent in it but just the basic stuffs will do the job.)
- [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and Install `VSCode` as text editor or any other editor, but I'd recommend using it for various linting and configurations I set up to get a clear and better code style.

# Getting Started

## Clone the repository

- Choose any directory for the cloning.
- Clone with HTTPS `git clone https://gitlab.com/shuri-dev/shuri-admin.git` or
- Clone with SSH `git clone git@gitlab.com:shuri-dev/shuri-admin.git`(Recommended).

Morealso open `Command Prompt` or any other command editor you have

### Unit Testing

For unit tests of the project type the following command:

### Code style flow

The linter tool for the style-flow is ESlint-airbnb, and it uses prettier as code formatter.
To enable `VS Code + ESLint + prettier` do the following the steps:

- Text editor [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- In VS Code, `Ctrl + Shift + X` (shortcut for extensions)
